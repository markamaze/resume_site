                    Hello, I am a self-taught Software Developer.  The following content contains a learning project as my portfolio and information on it's design, as well as my relevent experience and developed skills.  I chose to learn through the building of a single learning project because I believe it is beneficial to have a more top-down education of programming, opposed to building bits and pieces of software with no cohesion and overall goals.  The project is ongoing and opensource.  I would be thrilled to have others that believe in what I'm tring to build get on board if interested.

                The design goals of my program, Simpledoc, can essentially be described as an automated clerk (It should be called Radar really, as Cpl. Radar O'Riley was the ultimate clerk). It's goals are to model the structure and operations of a business, and implement rules and requirements of those operations.  Once the model is built, it would provide computer assistance in prompting users to complete paperwork, monitor for compliance of defined rules, and inform users when out of compliance or when action is needed.  The following video goes into more info about the goals of the program and how it can help any company use their time more efficiently and increase the quality of their business.

              I have designed my program as a client/server, using React on the front-end and plain Java on the back.  I use mostly object oriented methods with a little functional thrown in, where the back-end is essentially a Model, the front-end the View, and the controller is intermingled within the two.  The overall architecture of my business logic is designed to be a collection of Modules which will provide services with an API being responsible for the communication between the modules.  The primary module used to model the organizational structure and define the relationships of the company, is called the Agency Module.  The Forms module is the first additional module I'm building right now, which is responsible for form-building and data-collection.  Please see the following videos for more in depth discussion of my designs as they currently exist.

              This is my program as it currently exists on it's home site, https://simpledoc.herokuapp.com.  I do need to acknowledge that it is a work in progress, and much of my work up to this point has been with working out business logic, designing the overall architecture, building up the backend API, as well as learning everything along the way.  At this point I am working on continuing to get the logic I've designed implemented on the front-end.
              <br/>As of now, the front end only displays a set of Agent Objects that exist in the database, as I am building up the tools to perform CRUD operations on the data needed for the Agency Module.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>Since 2016 I have been working daily on enhancing my software development skillset. My portfolio project, Simpledoc, has been the primary area of directing my learning. It has led to understanding of how to work on a full stack application.  A particular concept I have been following, is at this point of my career to learn about everything within scope of building a project in order to enhance my overall understanding without just focusing on a specific area.  This has provided me with a higher level of understanding of why the more specific needs within a large scale application are what they are.  I have taken the approach of not simply putting the code that works, but to dig deep and understand why it is needed and how to apply the tools in any other context.  This is with the intent of becoming a more complete developer, with the ability to work in any context with any set goals.  As I grow as a developer it is my intention to solidify my skills and narrow my focus in whatever area is needed for whatever I am working on</p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>200+ quarter credit hours earned in Engineering, Math, Science, Communications.  I spent 2007-2009 in school full-time, mostly at Oregon Institute of Technology, but also went off and on while working full-time at various points.  After a period of time studying Economics at Portland State University, I decided to persue my goals outside of collage.  Shortly after that was when I found that an independent persuit of a career in Softare Development was just what I was looking for.  I have always loved learning, always been drawn to solving logical problems, and always found myself wanting to work with technology.  Seeing that software development and work in technology is a continuous persuit of knowledge and problem solving, I knew it was for me and I have spent every day since working on developing my skillset.  The knowledge I gained from my years of going to college off and on, was invaluable.  I learned how I learn and apply myself best, how to approach problems, how to utilize resources.  Though I didn't finish any degree, I gained a lot from that time and am very confident in my ability to learn, adapt, grow, problem solve.  I have learned how to look at a problem and expand the view upward and downward, seeking both a top-down and bottom-up understand.</p>
