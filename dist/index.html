          <h5>Project Purpose</h5>
            <p>
              This Android program is a personal budgeting tool designed to show a running balance of future transactions. By inputing all your income and expenses, and defining how often they occur, transactions are projected into the future and resulting balance calculated. This allows for seeing how every planned transaction impacts your balance, opposed to lumping in income and expenses over a period of time where the total adds up but may leave you with an overdrawn account before an income actually clears.
            </p>
            <p>
              FudgetBudget allows for quickly getting your budget up-to-date. In one action, you can either record or delete all past-due projections and either allow the balance to be calculated or enter a new balance yourself. As most personal budgeting is done looking forward at infrequent intervals, other personal budgeting tools can result in your budget becoming behind or inaccurate requiring you to first fix that. Fudging the balance and old transactions creates a special record which accounts for missing data and allows you to fix it any time should you want to. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Projected income and expenses can be modified as needed to achieve your financial goals/needs; whether they be to maintain a minimum balance amount, plan for future expenses, adjust future expenses to allow for spending now, identifying your expendable funds, and more. 
            </p>
          <h5>Technical Overview</h5>
            <p>
              FudgetBudget was developed using the Android Framework, implementing a form of Model-View-ViewModel architecture as well as LiveData updates. The primary object of the program is the Transaction, from which Projections are created, from which Records are created. A record balance is calculated as the sum of all records.

                  The design goals of my program, Simpledoc, can essentially be described as an automated clerk (It should be called Radar really, as Cpl. Radar O'Riley was the ultimate clerk). It's goals are to model the structure and operations of a business, and implement rules and requirements of those operations.  Once the model is built, it would provide computer assistance in prompting users to complete paperwork, monitor for compliance of defined rules, and inform users when out of compliance or when action is needed.  The following video goes into more info about the goals of the program and how it can help any company use their time more efficiently and increase the quality of their business.

                I have designed my program as a client/server, using React on the front-end and plain Java on the back.  I use mostly object oriented methods with a little functional thrown in, where the back-end is essentially a Model, the front-end the View, and the controller is intermingled within the two.  The overall architecture of my business logic is designed to be a collection of Modules which will provide services with an API being responsible for the communication between the modules.  The primary module used to model the organizational structure and define the relationships of the company, is called the Agency Module.  The Forms module is the first additional module I'm building right now, which is responsible for form-building and data-collection.  Please see the following videos for more in depth discussion of my designs as they currently exist.

                This is my program as it currently exists on it's home site, https://simpledoc.herokuapp.com.  I do need to acknowledge that it is a work in progress, and much of my work up to this point has been with working out business logic, designing the overall architecture, building up the backend API, as well as learning everything along the way.  At this point I am working on continuing to get the logic I've designed implemented on the front-end.
                <br/>As of now, the front end only displays a set of Agent Objects that exist in the database, as I am building up the tools to perform CRUD operations on the data needed for the Agency Module.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>Since 2016 I have been working daily on enhancing my software development skillset. My primary work has been through the development of software I designed to solve real-world problems. These learning projects have guided me as I continuously evaluate where I am relative to my goal and finding the questions and answers that allowed me to progress in my understanding and skill development.</p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>200+ quarter credit hours earned with a focus on STEM, social sciences, and communications.  I spent 2007-2009 in school full-time at Oregon Institute of Technology, but attended other colleges at various times while working. The knowledge I gained from my education developed my ability to learn, understand, and work within complex systems. Using these skills I began an independent study of software development and will continue indefinatly.</p>
